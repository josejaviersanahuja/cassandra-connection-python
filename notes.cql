# THINGS I HAVE LEARNT BY FORCE

# 1. text fields MUST have '' around them or "" around them. If you don't, you get an error.

# 2. When you have a composed primary key, the order of the fields in the primary key is important. When you make a GROUP BY, you can only apply the GORUP BY in the exact order of the primary key keys. If you don't, you get an error.
